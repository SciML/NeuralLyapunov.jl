    NeuralLyapunovStructure

Specifies the structure of the neural Lyapunov function and its derivative.

Allows the user to define the Lyapunov in terms of the neural network to 
structurally enforce Lyapunov conditions. 
network_dim is the dimension of the output of the neural network.
V(phi::Function, state, fixed_point) takes in the neural network, the state,
and the fixed_point, and outputs the value of the Lyapunov function at state
V̇(phi::Function, J_phi::Function, f::Function, state, fixed_point) takes in the
neural network, the jacobian of the neural network, the dynamics (as a function
of the state alone), the state, and the fixed_point, and outputs the time 
derivative of the Lyapunov function at state.

Creates a NeuralLyapunovStructure where the Lyapunov function is the L2 norm of
the neural network output plus a constant δ times a function pos_def.

The condition that the Lyapunov function must be minimized uniquely at the
fixed point can be represented as V(fixed_point) = 0, V(state) > 0 when 
state != fixed_point. This structure ensures V(state) ≥ 0. Further, if δ > 0
and pos_def(fixed_point, fixed_point) = 0, but pos_def(state, fixed_point) > 0 
when state != fixed_point, this ensures that V(state) > 0 when 
state != fixed_point. This does not enforce V(fixed_point) = 0, so that 
condition must included in the neural Lyapunov loss function.

grad_pos_def(state, fixed_point) should be the gradient of pos_def with respect
to state at state. If grad_pos_def is not defined, it is evaluated using grad,
which defaults to ForwardDiff.gradient.

The neural network output has dimension network_dim.

Specifies the form of the Lyapunov conditions to be used.

If check_nonnegativity is true, training will attempt to enforce

    relu(strength(state, fixed_point) - V(state)) = 0.0

# Examples

The condition that the Lyapunov function must be minimized uniquely at the
fixed point can be represented as V(fixed_point) = 0, V(state) > 0 when 
state != fixed_point. This could be enfored by V ≥ ||state - fixed_point||^2,

    strength(state, fixed_point) = ||state - fixed_point||^2,
paired with V(fixed_point) = 0, which can be enforced with

If V were structured such that it is always nonnegative, then V(fixed_point) = 0
is all that must be enforced in training for the Lyapunov function to be 
uniquely minimized at fixed_point. So, in that case, we would use 
    check_nonnegativity = false;  check_fixed_point = true

In either case, relu = (t) -> max(0.0, t) exactly represents the inequality,
