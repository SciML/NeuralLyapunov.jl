# Lyapunov Minimization Condition

The condition that the Lyapunov function ``V(x)`` must be minimized uniquely at the fixed point ``x_0`` is often represented as a requirement for ``V(x)`` to be positive away from the fixed point and zero at the fixed point.
Put mathematically, it is sufficient to require ``V(x) > 0 \, \forall x \ne x_0`` and ``V(x_0) = 0``.
We call such functions positive definite (around the fixed point ``x_0``).
The weaker condition that ``V(x) \ge 0 \, \forall x \ne x_0`` and ``V(x_0) = 0`` is positive *semi-*definiteness.

NeuralLyapunov.jl provides the [`LyapunovMinimizationCondition`](@ref) struct for users to specify the form of the minimization condition to enforce through training.

## Defining your own minimization condition

If a user wishes to define their own version of the minimization condition in a form other than
``V(x) ≥ \texttt{strength}(x, x_0)``,
they must define their own subtype of [`NeuralLyapunov.AbstractLyapunovMinimizationCondition`](@ref).

When constructing the PDESystem, [`NeuralLyapunovPDESystem`](@ref) uses [`NeuralLyapunov.check_nonnegativity`](@ref) to determine if it should include an equation equating the result of [`NeuralLyapunov.get_minimization_condition`](@ref) to zero.
It additionally uses [`NeuralLyapunov.check_minimal_fixed_point`](@ref) to determine if it should include the equation ``V(x_0) = 0``.
